TFseqTools v1.0

-- Input Parameters --
Cell barcodes (in R1 fastq file):
        Pattern = 'BU'
        Cell barcode sequence length = '16' [default to 10x protocol v3, use '--BC' option to change]
        UMI sequence length = '12' [default to 10x protocol v3, use '--UMI' option to change]
        According to barcode pattern, reads of R1 FastQ file should contain 28 characters.
TF barcodes (searched for in R2 bam file):
        Reference TF file = barcodes/tf_barcodes.txt
        Barcode 1 is searched for at pos [6419, 6429],  l = 11
        Barcode 2 is searched for at pos [6457, 6464],  l = 8
Log File = NONE (specify a log file using option --log)
Output folder = example/outputs/. Use '-o' option to change.
