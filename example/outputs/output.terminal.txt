TFseqTools v1.1

-- Input Parameters --
Cell barcodes (in R1 fastq file):
 	Pattern = 'BU'
	Cell barcode sequence length = '16'
	UMI sequence length = '12'
	According to barcode pattern, reads of R1 FastQ file should contain 28 characters.
TF barcodes (searched for in R2 bam file):
	Reference TF file = E:\GitHub\TFseqTools\example\barcodes\tf_barcodes.txt
	Barcode 1 is searched for at pos [6419, 6429],  l = 11
	Barcode 2 is searched for at pos [6457, 6464],  l = 8
Log File = E:\GitHub\TFseqTools\example\outputs\output.log.txt
Output folder = E:/GitHub/TFseqTools/example/outputs/. Use '-o' option to change.
